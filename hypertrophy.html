                        Hypertrophy training is a style of training that focuses on building muscle mass and strength,
                        but this time primarily focus is muscle mass. It’s about reaching that aesthetic “Greek God”
                        look with artistic qualities like flow and proportion. If you’re a somewhat experienced lifter
                        or simply did research on building muscle, you might’ve
                        heard of hypertrophy or hypertrophy training approach.

                        Muscular hypertrophy refers to an increase and growth of muscle mass. Muscle hypertrophy occurs
                        in response to various stimulus such as strength, weight- and resistance training. This is why
                        this word plays a huge role in the weightlifting industry.

                        When our body is put under a significant amount of mechanical stress, stimulation occurs during
                        contraction of the muscle. A repeated and systematic contraction (exercise) causes damage to the
                        muscle cells. After the workout, while muscles are resting, our body repairs those damages, new
                        muscles fibres replace the old, damaged ones, and this is where the muscle building process
                        takes place. To speed up and optimize that process we need nutrition, or protein to be exact as
                        a fuel. That’s why it’s crucial to take rest and refuel through nutrition, otherwise the breakup
                        process will be greater than the recovery itself, which will take a hit on your overall
                        well-being and progress.

                        If your goal is to gain muscle, the most effective way to induce muscle hypertrophy out of many
                        exercise variants is through weight training.
                        In weight training there are several styles of gym training approaches, each with its own focus
                        and benefits. It usually comes down to the 2 most common training styles – strength,
                        hypertrophy. Since our primary focus is optimizing muscle mass, hypertrophy approach is the one
                        to go, however first we should differentiate these styles to better know what we are working
                        with.
                        Strength training is a style of training that focuses on building strength and muscle mass, but
                        primarily focus is building strength.

                        hard, you still generate fatigue and stress by reaching true muscular failure.

                        Here you’d usually train with weights very close to your single weight-rep capacity – about

                        between about 3-5 minutes if not more. Without sufficient rest, you won’t be able to complete
                        the necessary intensity needed to gain strength.

                        should take as much rest as you need to fully recover for your next set. When you train to true
                        muscular failure, 1-2 minutes might not be enough to walk in for your next set, meaning you
                        won’t push as much weight and reps as you could. So take as much rest as you need to recover for
                        your next set.

                        groups and joints in one action, these exercises are heavy compound movements like bench, squat
                        and deadlift.
