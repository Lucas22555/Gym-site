                        Hello, my name is Lucas, I’m 22 years old finance student with a once strong passion for
                        strength training and muscle building.

                        One thing I want to clarify right off the bat is that I’m not a certified personal trainer; I
                        don’t hold any official certifications & qualifications in the fitness realm, nor have I trained
                        actual people as clients, however I gave numerous people lifting & nutrition advice, as well as
                        trained some under my supervision (again, not as official clients), which they are thankful for
                        to this day. This site is something I created based off years of personal experience in the
                        fitness field which led me to wanting to share my knowledge and help other individuals achieve
                        their fitness goals and lead healthier lives.

                        I joined the gym at 16 years of age, right before I turned 17. I grew up as a skinny kid
                        weighing at around 52-53 kilograms while being 173 cm. Can’t say I was too bothered by it at the
                        time nor was I bullied or picked up by classmates, but I certainly wasn’t too happy about my
                        looks either. Nonetheless I decided to join the gym to finally gain some muscle and weight. At
                        the time I didn’t have any knowledge or expertise on proper training, recovery, and nutrition
                        whatsoever. I just went 3-4 times a week, threw in random exercises (mostly bicep curls and
                        bench press), went home, and repeat it all next week.

                        After couple of months, I started noticing changes which made me even more motivated. After
                        nearly 8 months of training with slightly modified, but more or less same training routine I
                        barely noticed any significant changes – my progress stagnated. I then started to do heavy
                        research on optimal ways of training, eating, and recovering by watching videos and reading
                        articles. Gradually I incorporated it in my training and noticed significant changes overtime.
                        Of course, it’d be impossible for me to apply all that knowledge I gradually gained overnight;
                        muscle building is a slow process which also requires experience.

                <div class="para">
                    <p>
                        As a result of research, hard work and decent amount of experience my progress skyrocketed, I
                        gained around 1,3 kg of bodyweight a month (while being on a high caloric surplus). I reached my
                        heaviest weight in March of 2023, at 21 years of age – 68 kgs. But then, unfortunately due to
                        some health problems I had to abandon my “hobby”. Since then I lost about 10 kilos as well as
                        most of my strength and muscle, but knowledge and experienced stayed. So, if you are a growing
                        skinny teenager, you can probably, or at least partly relate to this, but even if aren’t, I hope
                        this page can give you a better understanding on who I am and help you in achieving your fitness
                        goals.
